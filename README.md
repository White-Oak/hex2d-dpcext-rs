# hex2d-dpcext

## Introduction

DPC's semi-private extensions to hex2d-rs.

As [hex2d-rs] is supposed to be simple and stable library, I've decided to
share more complex utilities in a separate crate: [hex2d-dpcext-rs]. In time,
maybe some of the code here will be worth moving to the main library.

[hex2d-rs]: http://github.com/dpc/hex2d-rs
[hex2d-dpcext-rs]: http://github.com/dpc/hex2d-dpcext-rs

Read [Documentation](//dpc.github.io/hex2d-dpcext-rs/) for details.

Use [hex2d-rs]'s [issues](//github.com/dpc/hex2d-rs/issues/) to report issues with this library.
